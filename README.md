## relic-warehouses
A warehouse system that I create out of sheer boredom. Just btw.. 🙂

## 🚧 A bit of progress I made
The interior I'm using is a bit empty. A bit too empty. So, I added a few more props to the whole interior to make it more comfy.

Should I add a config for that, so everyone can decide if they want these props included?

## 📑 Some data for the script
`📍` The coords of the empty warehouse interior that I'm using are: `vector3(800, -3000, -70)`. The Interior Id in this case is: `289537`.

You have the opportunity to make the interior a bit more homely with a few props, even when it is empty.
