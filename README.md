A warehouse system that I create out of sheer boredom. Just btw.. üôÇ

## ‚õî The current problem
Soo. At the moment I'm trying to set up some warehouse types like the meth type first. I just need a way to place interior props like normal props at the moment and to be honest I'm getting a bit stuck on it. I don't know how long that will take.

I just want to give everyone the chance to do whatever they want in their warehouse and for example there are two levels for meth: ‚ÄúBasic‚Äù and ‚ÄúUpgraded‚Äù. I want to use the original props from the GTA Online Meth lab. But they are bound as interior props to the original meth interior.

I have actually found out how. But now that means I have to set up the individual levels and types of the warehouses. I hate that.
 
## üöß A bit of progress I made
The interior I'm using is a bit empty. A bit too empty. So, I added a few more props to the whole interior to make it more comfy.

Should I add a config for that, so everyone can decide if they want these props included? - I'm going to do it like this. You will be able to decide for yourself in the config which props you want to have activated.

I've been working a bit on the functionality of the animation for the laptop in the warehouse. It works perfectly so far^^

During my work I became aware of [`GetScriptTaskStatus`](https://docs.fivem.net/natives/?_0x77F1BEB8863288D5). It's really some good shit

## üìë Some data for the script
`üìç` The coords of the empty warehouse interior that I'm using are: `vector3(800, -3000, -70)`. The Interior Id in this case is: `289537`.

You have the opportunity to make the interior a bit more homely with a few props, even when it is empty.
